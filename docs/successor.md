# Successor app

Carryover:

* Node-based
* All content is flat files

Must-haves:

* Passport for login (with FB integration)
* Push notifications
* File upload and hosting
* WYSIWYG editor
* Better mobile CSS
* Folder structure
* Full menu customization (not just UL/LI)
* Use Express correctly (static files, middleware, etc)
* Comments, talk pages, forum, or somesuch

Would-be-nice:

* MP3 player for hosted music
* Embedded Spotify, Amazon Music, Apple Music, SoundCloud, etc
* Image optimizer
* Multiple file formats: html, md, wiki
* Integrated backup (instead of assuming the host folder has Dropbox)
* Integrated revision tracking (git diff lib?)
* Forking at article or folder level (might serve the purpose of Genesis' site-wide versioning)
* React frontend
