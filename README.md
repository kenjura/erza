# erza
Erza is a wiki frontend. The wiki itself consists of text files in git. So there's your versioning, branching, diff, etc.


# how to deploy
for now:
* rsync -arvu (repo root) (dest)



# feature wish list

* preview mode while editing articles
* better feedback for save buttons in edit mode
* DONE - migrate all style2, badge2 etc back to 1
* edit mode buttons at bottom, better style
* edit mode navigable with side nav
* when editing Home (as opposed to _home) the article should save as "_home.txt" but doesn't
* skins: multiple different HTML choices, each page can use a different one
